* What is rtklib-cli?

rtklib-cli is a series of preset bash commands to process GNSS data in
Post Processed Kinematics (PPK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP)
using the Command Line Interface (CLI) of open source
[RTKLIB](https://github.com/rtklibexplorer/RTKLIB). You'd like to
process your data in PPK looking at standard examples or don't have
the time to dive into the many parameters? This can be useful to you.
