* What is rtklib-cli?

rtklib-cli is a series of preset bash commands to process GNSS data in
Post Processed Kinematics (PPK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP)
using the Command Line Interface (CLI) of open source [[https://github.com/rtklibexplorer/RTKLIB][RTKLIB]]. If you'd
like process your data in PPK looking at examples and/or don't have
the time to dive into the many available parameters, this might be
useful to you.
